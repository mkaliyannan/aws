# aws
These below scripts I created to identify the AWS resources usage in multiple AWS accounts. 
I haven't covered everything, but you can get

* EC2
* AMI
* EIP
* S3
* Snapshots

This script will check on each region and will create csv to produce the data.. and you can analyze the cost where you spending.
I am not a developer, but I did my best.

Make sure you installed the python modules as described in each of the python scripts header.
EIP and AMI : you can remove from your account by passing arguments.
This is useful to track the expenses in AWS accounts, that we haven't aware the resources running in different region.
